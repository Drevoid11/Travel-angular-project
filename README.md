  2. Error/Exception handling: For different webcontent the webpages get routed to different componets via a routerlink which is displayed at the search bar. If the routerlink is entered manually then two scenarios occur. viz[Success and Failure].
      #[Success]- In the case of correct url the webpage get routed to the page mentioned.
